Link grammar

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar
    Summary:
        Link grammar connects the words in a sentence with links, similar in form to a catena. Unlike the catena or a traditional dependency grammar, the marking of the head-dependent relationship is optional for most languages, becoming mandatory only in free-word-order languages (such as Turkish,[3] Finnish, Hungarian, Lithuanian[4]). That is, in English, the subject-verb relationship is "obvious", in that the subject is almost always to the left of the verb, and thus no specific indication of dependency needs to be made. In the case of subject-verb inversion, a distinct link type is employed. For free word-order languages, this can no longer hold, and a link between the subject and verb must contain an explicit directional arrow to indicate which of the two words is which.

    Summary:
        Covers all branches of computational linguistics and language engineering, wherever they incorporate a multilingual aspect. It features papers that cover the theoretical, descriptive or computational aspects of any of the following topics:
            - compilation and use of bi- and multilingual corpora
            - computer-aided language instruction and learning
            - computational implications of non-Roman character sets
            - connectionist ?are available on request by contacting LSA Support at CU Boulder, the people who manage the LSA web site at Colorado
		introduced in Landauer and Dumais (1997) as a way of evaluating algorithms for measuring degree of similarity between words
		subsequently used by many other researchers
